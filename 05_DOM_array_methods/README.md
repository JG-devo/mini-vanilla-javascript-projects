## DOM Array Methods

Feel free to review the two branches which include the standard code and a MVC version.

The goal of this project is to explore some built in array methods like filter, map, reduce, forEach, etc

The MVC version includes a few interesting ideas on how to update the DOM dynamically when adding new users (rather than reloading the entire main element from scratch). The same is carried over to the doubleMoney method which only updates the inner text.

Overall, an interesting project to play with. Loads of opportunities to practice different ideas.
