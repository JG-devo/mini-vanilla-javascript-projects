## 20 Vanilla Javascript Projects

This repo includes the 20 projects taught by [Brad Traversy on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/), but with a few twists.

For example:

- In some cases, CSS is swapped with SCSS via PARCEL bundler
- or javascript is re-written into different patterns _i.e. MVC_
- DRY-er versions that made more sense to me personally...

If you are already taking the course and looking for a few ideas of how the code may be written differently, feel free to download this repo and explore the code. I'm in no way an expert, but my approach may be interesting to look through if you want a few additional ideas and, what I feel are 'improvements'.. :)

One of the best examples has to be `project 04 - Exchange calculator`. Checkout the `MVC-version` git branch within that folder and the readme doc for more details.
