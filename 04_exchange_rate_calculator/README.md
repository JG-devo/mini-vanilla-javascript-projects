## Quick Overview

The original code as taught in Brad's course helps as a starting point but is not as DRY as it could be.

I've included two alternatives:

- The main git branch has a simple implementation of JS code, quite similar to the original with a few interesting tweaks.
- The MVC git branch is another version using the MVC pattern with classes, which is more advanced but awesome to play with.
