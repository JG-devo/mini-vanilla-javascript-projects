## Meal Finder App (Foodie Finder)

- Unstructured JS is on main branch
- Structured JS is on MVC-version branch

In this project, rather than code along with the course, I checked out how the code works and came up with a completely different version of my own with loads more functionality.

The idea behind this project is to use the MealDB API to generate data that gets shown on the app. For the version I created, the search function utilises search via word, ID and a single alphabetical letter. Any failures produces an error on screen via a try/catch block.

There are still a few bugs here and there, but 98% of the app is complete and works beautifully.
